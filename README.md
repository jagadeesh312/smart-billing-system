## Day 2 – Repository Initialization

Today I created this repository to start building a Smart Billing System website.

Day 1: Initialize Smart Billing System project structure
• Created the initial project repository
• Designed the base HTML structure for the Smart Billing System
• Set up core layout sections (login, dashboard, billing area)
• Planned application flow for Admin and Employee roles
• Defined basic UI structure to support future features
• Focused on clean structure and scalability
Day 2: Implement core logic and complete functional flow
